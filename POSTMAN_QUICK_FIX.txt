QUICK FIX FOR POSTMAN:

1. Click "Body" tab in Postman
2. Select "raw" radio button
3. Change dropdown from "Text" to "JSON"
4. Type this in the text area:
   {"test": "data"}
5. Go to "Headers" tab
6. Add: Content-Type = application/json
7. Click Send

The problem: content-length is 0 means NO BODY is being sent!
You MUST type JSON in the Body tab text area!
